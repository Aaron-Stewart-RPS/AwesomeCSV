# Awesome CSV

CSV remains the most futuristic data format from the distant past.

XML has risen and fallen. JSON is just a flash in the pan. YAML is a poisoned chalice. **CSV will outlast them all.**

When the last cockroach ceases to live, her final act will be to scratch her date of death in a CSV file, for posterity.

Here are some awesome tools for dealing with CSV:

`*` <span id='footnote1' ></span> I'm the author of NimbleText. Of course I put it first on the list. If I didn't personally rate it I wouldn't have spent so much time making and improving it!

`**` <span id='footnote2' ></span> I wrote Agnes but don't really endorse it for others to use (thus haven't migrated the source code to github). It's a slow and non-streaming. On the plus side, it has a more comprehensive test suite and simpler api than most.
